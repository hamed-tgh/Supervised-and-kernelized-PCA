# Supervised-and-kernelized-supervised-PCA

# what is PCA?
PCA, is a statistical procedure that allows you to summarize the information content in large data tables by means of a smaller set of “summary indices” that can be more easily visualized and analyzed.

# why or when we have to use Supervised PCA?
SPCA, which is a generalization of PCA, is uniquely effective for regression and classification problems with high-dimensional input data.

# Why we implement kernelized SPCA?

based on kernel trcick, if we find a way to map the data from N-dimensional space to M-dimensional space, where M > N, we will be able to find a decision surface that clearly divides between different classes.
